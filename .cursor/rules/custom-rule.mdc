# Your rule content

- we use python 3.13 typing => no Optional, Tuple, List
- We use pytest with parametrize for testing
- We use logging and not print statements
- For working with typescript we use yarn, not npm
- To check syntax we run: pre-commit run --all-files after every change that you proposed
- We prefer using pathlib over os.path
